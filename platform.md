# Cutting edge application platform

> The SH platform aims to deliver the absolute cutting edge in features, performance, security, scalability and reliability built on a robust stack of existing open source platforms and products while still providing developers and operators with a simple out-of-the-box solution for any modern app.

Now that we have that out of the way let's look at some concrete features that define what we think is cutting edge and how the SH platform packages and delivers them.

#### Secure by default

SuperHook is built on top of [SuperLogin](/superlogin.md), a NodeJS/Express user authentication solution centered on providing the best of breed practices and technologies under on simple and secure roof. From [their GitHub page](https://github.com/colinskow/superlogin):

> User authentication is often the hardest part of building any web app, especially if you want to integrate multiple providers. Now all the tough work has been done for you so you can relax and create with less boilerplate!

SuperLogin leverages [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) together with [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com), both with a long track record of security and performance in the OSS community to provide an end-to-end to end solution for user-centered security based on the industry standard [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
